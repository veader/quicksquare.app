                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                <h2>Simple Version</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong><em>Quicksquare does not record, collect, or retain any of your information.</em></strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    The only time any of your information leaves your device while using <em>Quicksquare</em> is when necessary
                    for communications with the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/places-api/">Foursquare API</a>.
                </p>

                <h2>Technical Bits</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to communicate with the Foursquare API, <em>Quicksquare</em> must retain an OAuth token. This
                    token is securely stored within the Keychain on the device. <em>Quicksquare</em> never transmits this token
                    to any other server than those used to operate the Foursquare API.
                    <br/><br/>

                    Location Services is required to use <em>Quicksquare</em>. The location information provided by Location
                    Services is never transmited to any other server than those used to operate the Foursquare API. Location Services
                    is only used when the app is running in the foreground.
                </p>

                <h2>Usual Legal Jargon</h2>

                <h3>Personally-Identifiable Information</h3>
                <p>
                    <em>Quicksquare</em> does not record or retain any Personally-Identifiable Information outside of your device.
                    The only information stored on the device is the OAuth token mentioned above.
                </p>

                <h3>Business Transfer</h3>
                <p>
                    If <em>Quicksquare</em>, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that
                    <em>Quicksquare</em> goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or
                    be amended.
                </p>

                <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    Although any changes to this policy will most likely be minor (<em>see change log below</em>),
                    <em>Quicksquare</em> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time and at <em>Quicksquare</em>'s
                    sole discretion. Use of <em>Quicksquare</em> after the policy change will constitute your acceptance
                    of any changes.
                </p>

                <h3>Idemnity</h3>
                <p>
                  You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities
                  and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in
